Tools to generate STDHEP files with DBD standard conditions.

(1) Configuration
  Many configuration parameters are defined by files in conf directory.
  Especially, do not forget following files.
   conf/common/setup.bash  : Setup environment parameters to run physsim
   conf/common/common.defs : User dependant parameters for Bases, Spring, etc.
   conf/common/process.list : Define processID, process name, final states, polarization, etc.
            This file is used to create run directory.
   dbs/common.defs   : host dependant entries for database records.

(2) Create directories to run job.
  At any place, do 

  $(KFLIBROOT)/dbd/genprod/bin/mkjobs.sh 
  
  Replies to questions.  With the default setting, directories to run jobs
  are created under jobs/ directory.  jobs/allsub.sh can be used to submit 
  jobs in all directories to LSF batch system.
