1) config/lclib.tmpl renamed to config/kflib.tmpl
   All Imakefiles have been modified accordingly.

2) "make depend" now uses rmkdepend

depend:: $(SRCS) $(HDRS) $(FSRCS)
        for i in $(SRCS) $(FSRCS); do \
        rmkdepend -a -- $(CXXFLAGS) $(INCPATH) -- $$i; done

3) xGV2FB added to SMCONS.inc and is initialized in insmcn.F
   in both gen_lib/sm and dgen_lib/sm.

4) Conversion to new BASES/SPRING using bin/tobasesxx
