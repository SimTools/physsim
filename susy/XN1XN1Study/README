CAUTION:

Currently chi^0_1 is supposed to decay via
chi^0_1 --> tau^- + stau_1^+ or tau^+ + stau_1^-
where stau_1^1 is assumed to be quasi-stable.

Particle ID of stau_1 is set to 13 (mu) to force
the hadronizer to treat it as a heavy muon.

Model parameters such as (m0,mu,M2,tanb,Atau) should
be adjusted as needed. Notice that in the convention
used in this generator, mu is always positive and
tanb may become negative.
