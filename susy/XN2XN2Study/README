CAUTION:

Currently chi^0_2 is supposed to decay via
chi^0_2 --> sf + fbar --> chi^0_1 + f + fbar
        --> f + sfbar --> f + fbar + chi^0_1
        --> chi^0_1 + Z --> chi^0_1 + f + fbar
where sf or sfbar are the lightest in each species: snu_e, se_R,
su_R, sd_R, snu_mu, smu_R, sc_R, ss_R, snu_tau. stau_1, st_1,
and sb_1. See fulnxx.F for details.

When all of the above three decay channels are open, one usually
needs to make NCALL very large, to correctly detect mass peaks
in the phase space. Check BASES outputs to confirm convergence 
of the Monte Carlo integration.
